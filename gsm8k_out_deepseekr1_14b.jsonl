{"question": "Janet\u2019s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?\n", "golden_answer": "Janet sells 16 - 3 - 4 = <<16-3-4=9>>9 duck eggs a day.\nShe makes 9 * 2 = $<<9*2=18>>18 every day at the farmer\u2019s market.\n#### 18<|endoftext|>", "chat_answer": "<think>\nFirst, I need to determine the total number of eggs Janet's ducks lay each day, which is 16 eggs.\n\nNext, I'll account for how many eggs Janet uses herself. She eats three eggs for breakfast every morning and uses four eggs for baking muffins daily. That means she consumes a total of 3 + 4 = 7 eggs each day.\n\nSubtracting the eggs Janet uses from the total laid will give me the number of eggs available to sell. So, 16 eggs minus 7 eggs equals 9 eggs that are left to be sold.\n\nFinally, I'll calculate how much money Janet makes by selling these remaining eggs at $2 per egg. Multiplying 9 eggs by $2 per egg gives her a daily revenue of $18.\n</think>\n\nLet's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Total Eggs Laid Daily:**\n   \\[\n   16 \\text{ eggs}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Eggs Consumed for Breakfast and Baking:**\n   - **Breakfast:** \\(3 \\text{ eggs}\\)\n   - **Baking Muffins:** \\(4 \\text{ eggs}\\)\n   \n   **Total Eggs Used:**\n   \\[\n   3 + 4 = 7 \\text{ eggs}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Eggs Available for Sale:**\n   \\[\n   16 - 7 = 9 \\text{ eggs}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Revenue from Selling Eggs:**\n   \\[\n   9 \\text{ eggs} \\times \\$2/\\text{egg} = \\$18\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{18}\n\\]", "result": true, "output_length": 208, "time": 7.628495216369629}
